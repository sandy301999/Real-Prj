Got it! Let’s do a **simple, Helm-free, YAML-based Prometheus monitoring setup** for your `vpromc` pod so it’s **interview-friendly** and easy to explain.

---

## **1️⃣ Deploy Prometheus Manually (No Helm)**

### Prometheus Deployment

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: prometheus
  namespace: monitoring
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: prometheus
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: prometheus
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: prometheus
        image: prom/prometheus:latest
        ports:
        - containerPort: 9090
        volumeMounts:
        - name: prometheus-config
          mountPath: /etc/prometheus
      volumes:
      - name: prometheus-config
        configMap:
          name: prometheus-config
```

### Prometheus ConfigMap

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: prometheus-config
  namespace: monitoring
data:
  prometheus.yml: |
    global:
      scrape_interval: 15s
    scrape_configs:
      - job_name: 'vpromc'
        static_configs:
          - targets: ['vpromc:11211']   # Memcached pod IP/Service
```

### Prometheus Service

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: prometheus
  namespace: monitoring
spec:
  selector:
    app: prometheus
  ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 9090
      targetPort: 9090
```

---

## **2️⃣ Expose Metrics in `vpromc` Pod**

For Memcached (or any pod):

```yaml
metadata:
  annotations:
    prometheus.io/scrape: "true"
    prometheus.io/port: "11211"
```

* Prometheus will scrape metrics from this pod.
* If it’s a Java app, `/metrics` endpoint would be used instead of TCP port.

---

## **3️⃣ Validate Prometheus Scraping**

```bash
kubectl port-forward svc/prometheus 9090:9090 -n monitoring
```

* Open `http://localhost:9090/targets` → confirm `vpromc` is listed.

---

## **4️⃣ Optional: Create Alert Rules**

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: alert-rules
  namespace: monitoring
data:
  alerts.yml: |
    groups:
    - name: vpromc-alerts
      rules:
      - alert: HighCPU
        expr: container_cpu_usage_seconds_total{pod="vpromc"} > 0.8
        for: 2m
        labels:
          severity: warning
        annotations:
          summary: "Pod vpromc CPU > 80%"
```

* You can mount this into Prometheus to enable alerting.

---

## **5️⃣ Interview-Ready Explanation**

> “I coordinated with the observability team to ensure Prometheus could scrape metrics from our pods. We annotated pods with scrape ports, verified Prometheus targets, and confirmed dashboards in Grafana displayed CPU, memory, and application metrics. Alerts were tested by simulating load, ensuring timely notification for high CPU or memory usage.”

---

If you want, I can **also create a simple end-to-end YAML** that includes:

* `vpromc` deployment
* Prometheus deployment
* Service
* Scrape config

…all in **one file**, ready to show as a demo example in an interview.

Do you want me to do that?
